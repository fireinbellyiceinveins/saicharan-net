When i discovered Casey few years back, i was suprised by his consistency of vlogging for 800+ days. EVERY SINGLE DAY. 

I thought it’s insane. I couldn’t do that. Neither i have the discipline, the skilll.

Today I came across a guy - Jordan Gonen. Gave me exactly the Casey vibes. This guy has blogged for 3 years. EVERY SINGLE DAY.

I thought it’s insane. But, I could do that? Atleast I could give it a try.

This is an attempt at that. Writing first blog at 1:33AM, Jan 12, 2025.

This 2025, I want to become cool. COOL is my new objective.

How to be cool?

By being more than my work.

So far 100%, without any hesitancy i could say that i’m nothing more than my work. If you remove work from my life. I’m nothing.

— Reading “Think Again”, a paragraph says - during the mann of gulch although Wagner Dodge asks his colleagues to leave their bags and run. People ignore because deep down they know that they are nothing without those tools.

This deeply resonated with me. Because that’s me. So i want to change that this year and become cool.

You can become cool by doing more than work:

- Reading Books
- Learning a new language
- Fitness
- Obsessed about something etc.,

my topics of 2025:

- Reading books
- Upskilling in work
- Health/Fitness
- Watching F1
- Now, attempting to write every single day.
